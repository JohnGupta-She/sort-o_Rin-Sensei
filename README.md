## Bubble Sort:
### Best Case: increasing order
O(1): When the list is already in the right order, no swaps are made, while the same amount of comparisons are used in every case.
### Worst Case: decreasing order
O(n^2): When the list is in decreasing order, every swap possible must be made to put it back in order: every n(n-1)/2 (same amount of comparisons are used).

## Selection Sort:
O(n): There is no best or worst case, all cases must use the same amount of comparisons and the same amount of swaps (since even if an element starts in the same place, it is still swapped with itself)

## Insertion Sort:
### Best Case: increasing order
O(1): When the list is already in the right order, no swaps are made and less comparisons are used.

### Worst Case: decreasing order
O(n^2): When the list is in decreasing order, every swap is used because every insertion needs to be "walked" to the front. Every comparison possible is also used because every swap needs a comparison.
